# WebXmlExploiter
The WebXmlExploiter is a tool to exploit exposed by misconfiguration or path traversal web.xml files.<br> 
It will try to download all .class and xml files based on the information extracted from the web.xml file.

## Notes ##
- WebXmlExploiter is an exploitation tool only, not a vulnerability scanner.
- I will not add a brute-forcing feature since tools like wfuzz,ffuzz, and burp suite can do it better.
- I recommend running the jadx to decompile the .class files

### Installation ###
Download the latest release and unpack it in the desired location.<br>
Remember to install GoLang in case you want to run from the source.<br>
WebXmlExploiter uses the github.com/antchfx/xmlquery libraries.

Check the following link for more information:
[https://github.com/antchfx/xmlquery/](https://github.com/antchfx/xmlquery/)
- Run: go get github.com/antchfx/xmlquery before running the WebXmlExploiter
